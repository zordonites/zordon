========================================
1. Personal Route
  - Use Jonny's ad-hoc profile, which entails:
    * Adding each users UUDID (can see how we did this with Jelly)
    * Deploy via AppCenter or maybe Testflight
2. Ford Route
  - use dcs to generate certs
    * Replace the generated ios project with react-native project
    * Deploy via appCenter
3. FordX Route
  - Same as personal but we get fordx to buy the apple dev license
